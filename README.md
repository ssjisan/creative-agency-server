I developed this app for a Developer firm. They are working with creating a website, mobile app, graphics design related staffs like posters, visiting card, flyers. 
  1.User can place their order to make the desired website by uploading a sample image. 
  2.User can see their dashboard with ordered items, and they can review this firm work. 
  3.There is an admin panel for viewing their orders. They can add new services.
  
I used ReactJS, React Router, Firebase Authentication for user/ admin login. NodeJS and MongoDB are used for backend services. And Bootstrap, HTML, CSS used for designing the site.
